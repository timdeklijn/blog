What happens when I put code at the top?

``` python
import os
os.path.join("a", "b")
```

This is some random content. For how long should I type until it is not on the frontpage anymore? This is what I want to know. It looks like it takes quite some time until the text falls of the frontpage. So let me copy this paragraph a few times.

And of course the big question is: 'How we can we render code?'. The answer is here:

``` python
import os
os.path.join("a", "b")
```

This looks more then fine. I do like this.

Then I want to know if I can render math on this platform:

$$
f(x) = x \times 20
$$

This was possible after adding a call to the **mathjax partial** in the footer.
